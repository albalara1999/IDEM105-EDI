What could we do with those posts?\\n\\n00:00:18 Speaker_2\\n\\nOr.\\n\\n00:00:19 Speaker_1\\n\\nIt's something 2D.\\n\\n00:00:21 Speaker_1\\n\\nOr 3D is possible too.\\n\\n00:00:24 Speaker_2\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:00:24 Speaker_1\\n\\nI think it's possible.\\n\\n00:00:25\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:00:27 Speaker_2\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:00:30 Speaker_2\\n\\nWe do want to make a because it says here you could create a product to process a system or engage with a particular environment.\\n\\n00:00:39 Speaker_2\\n\\nOr even tell a story. Tell a story like.\\n\\n00:00:41 Speaker_1\\n\\nWhere where is where does it say that?\\n\\n00:00:45 Speaker_2\\n\\nThis one ohh.\\n\\n00:00:47 Speaker_2\\n\\nCould do like a level you know.\\n\\n00:00:51 Speaker_1\\n\\nOhh that's that's a good idea.\\n\\n00:00:53 Speaker_2\\n\\nSomething like.\\n\\n00:00:55 Speaker_3\\n\\nOr.\\n\\n00:00:58\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:01:00 Speaker_1\\n\\nEngagement.\\n\\n00:01:01\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:01:07 Speaker_1\\n\\nWe can't tell a story of a post it sticking to the board and then just falling like this by just doing a small.\\n\\n00:01:15 Speaker_2\\n\\nYeah. Nice.\\n\\n00:01:16\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:01:19 Speaker_2\\n\\nSort of. Hidden zooms in, lotions out. I guess if you if you zoom. So if this posted it starts here as empty posted then it.\\n\\n00:01:21 Speaker_1\\n\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\n00:01:28 Speaker_2\\n\\nWe'll continue smaller and smaller. So. So in the end, you see it both, it's sort of sticking somewhere I guess and then it's falling I guess and coming loose at the edges and then?\\n\\n00:01:28 Speaker_1\\n\\nYes, yes.\\n\\n00:01:37 Speaker_1\\n\\nYes. And then just follow.\\n\\n00:01:40 Speaker_2\\n\\nFalling down.\\n\\n00:01:42 Speaker_2\\n\\nSure, if that's.\\n\\n00:01:44 Speaker_2\\n\\nDoable.\\n\\n00:01:55 Speaker_2\\n\\nSo we can plan that out. So let's how long each.\\n\\n00:02:01 Speaker_2\\n\\nIt's scenes should should take or yeah.\\n\\n00:02:05\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n00:02:06 Speaker_1\\n\\nAnd according to that, we can just put our first image last image and in the middle so we can combine them, but.\\n\\n00:02:13 Speaker_2\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:02:15 Speaker_2\\n\\nYeah, check it. Connect them? Yes. Sounds good. So if we draw like the first.\\n\\n00:02:23 Speaker_2\\n\\nWe can try to make.\\n\\n00:02:26 Speaker_1\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:02:27 Speaker_2\\n\\nWhich would be the first?\\n\\n00:02:30 Speaker_3\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\n00:02:34 Speaker_1\\n\\nYeah, the, the the end product is not that important. I guess the we will look to the process of thinking.\\n\\n00:02:43 Speaker_2\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:02:45 Speaker_2\\n\\nBefore that would be fine. Probably yes. So if this gets smaller.\\n\\n00:02:46 Speaker_1\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n00:02:56 Speaker_2\\n\\nSo we'll start as a.\\n\\n00:02:59 Speaker_2\\n\\nPost it sort of zooming out or something I guess.\\n\\n00:03:02 Speaker_1\\n\\nYes, yes.\\n\\n00:03:03 Speaker_2\\n\\nBut it's so mean.\\n\\n00:03:05 Speaker_2\\n\\nSo it starts as an empty state and then sort.\\n\\n00:03:08 Speaker_1\\n\\nUh-huh.\\n\\n00:03:08 Speaker_2\\n\\nOf.\\n\\n00:03:09 Speaker_2\\n\\nZooms in until you have a post it on the on the boards basically.\\n\\n00:03:15 Speaker_2\\n\\nDo we also draw the boards like something like this or something? So now you see that it's sort of sticking on something, maybe the little.\\n\\n00:03:19 Speaker_1\\n\\nIndian.\\n\\n00:03:23\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\n00:03:26 Speaker_2\\n\\nThen you somewhere in the middle you see it's coming loose or.\\n\\n00:03:31 Speaker_2\\n\\nSomething I don't. I don't know how to draw this. I'm not as good at drawing.\\n\\n00:03:34 Speaker_1\\n\\nAnd then just falling like this, it's going well.\\n\\n00:03:42 Speaker_2\\n\\nLike this and then at the end of the board here for down to the ground, yeah.\\n\\n00:03:47 Speaker_1\\n\\nAnd fall.\\n\\n00:03:51 Speaker_2\\n\\nAnd in the end you only have to have the board I guess. So then or maybe just have a little bit of the, I don't.\\n\\n00:03:55 Speaker_1\\n\\nEmpty boards.\\n\\n00:03:59 Speaker_1\\n\\nKnow. Oh, you're. Oh, you did it towards us from the beginning. OK. Sorry. I thought you were doing.\\n\\n00:04:07 Speaker_1\\n\\nFrom your side, but you did it for us to say it. Well, thank you. OK.\\n\\n00:04:09 Speaker_2\\n\\nNo, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah.\\n\\n00:04:13 Speaker_1\\n\\nYeah. Yeah, I think that's all.\\n\\n00:04:14 Speaker_2\\n\\nLike I start with an empty and then like this and then next one is going to be like this and then this is going to be like this until it's like on the boards.\\n\\n00:04:19 Speaker_1\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n00:04:23 Speaker_2\\n\\nI guess and then it will start to have little start to come loose. So you see little shadows, I guess because the light is coming out and then it goes down, down, down, down until it's almost or disappears.\\n\\n00:04:24 Speaker_1\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:04:37 Speaker_1\\n\\nIt disappeared.\\n\\n00:04:39 Speaker_3\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n00:04:41 Speaker_3\\n\\nSorry, I don't. I don't really follow up. I'm.\\n\\n00:04:43 Speaker_1\\n\\nI think.\\n\\n00:04:45 Speaker_2\\n\\nSorry, it's good. It's good.\\n\\n00:04:46 Speaker_3\\n\\nSo it's a it's it's a story or I don't know what's.\\n\\n00:04:51 Speaker_3\\n\\nKind of design.\\n\\n00:04:51 Speaker_1\\n\\nWe do, we just whatever we want with this poster, it's it can be a design. It can tell a story, it can be everything. So.\\n\\n00:04:55 Speaker_3\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:04:58 Speaker_1\\n\\nThis.\\n\\n00:05:00 Speaker_1\\n\\nThinking of doing like the.\\n\\n00:05:02 Speaker_1\\n\\nSo when you watch it, you see a story of a.\\n\\n00:05:04 Speaker_1\\n\\nPost it, yeah.\\n\\n00:05:05 Speaker_1\\n\\nThe post it it's sticking somewhere and then it starts to fall down.\\n\\n00:05:11 Speaker_1\\n\\nThat's all.\\n\\n00:05:13 Speaker_3\\n\\nFall down means.\\n\\n00:05:15 Speaker_1\\n\\nFalling down, yeah.\\n\\n00:05:16 Speaker_2\\n\\nSee you next week.\\n\\n00:05:17 Speaker_3\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:05:18 Speaker_1\\n\\nLike we did in the board, you know, we put it and it fell.\\n\\n00:05:21 Speaker_3\\n\\nDown. OK. OK, so so we need to draw some pictures on the posting and let one like one by one.\\n\\n00:05:24 Speaker_1\\n\\nThat's all.\\n\\n00:05:27 Speaker_2\\n\\nYeah. Yeah, basically.\\n\\n00:05:30 Speaker_1\\n\\nYes, yes. And then when we do like this, we see the story like.\\n\\n00:05:33 Speaker_3\\n\\nA movie? Yeah. OK.\\n\\n00:05:36 Speaker_2\\n\\nSo do we start from like the last one from the right and then?\\n\\n00:05:39 Speaker_1\\n\\nYes, the last one is on the top, OK.\\n\\n00:05:41 Speaker_2\\n\\nYeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. I was gonna purchase those.\\n\\n00:05:45\\n\\nMindy.\\n\\n00:05:46 Speaker_1\\n\\nThings maybe we can combine these two. We have a good time.\\n\\n00:05:54 Speaker_2\\n\\nYeah, we could.\\n\\n00:05:55 Speaker_1\\n\\nYeah, we can stick them by just taking.\\n\\n00:05:57 Speaker_1\\n\\nThis part off? Ohh yeah that's fair.\\n\\n00:06:01 Speaker_2\\n\\nYeah, that's yeah. I don't know. I think this is already going to take a long time, I guess maybe.\\n\\n00:06:05 Speaker_1\\n\\nYes, yes, yes.\\n\\n00:06:08 Speaker_2\\n\\nCan we use the orange to see how maybe how fast the story is? So if we just, does anyone ever have been OK?\\n\\n00:06:12 Speaker_1\\n\\nYeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, they left this.\\n\\n00:06:17 Speaker_1\\n\\nOne with us.\\n\\n00:06:22 Speaker_2\\n\\nSo what did they just?\\n\\n00:06:24 Speaker_2\\n\\nOK, start from the last.\\n\\n00:06:25 Speaker_2\\n\\nOne.\\n\\n00:06:26 Speaker_2\\n\\nI'm just going to see how fast it sort of zooms out so.\\n\\n00:06:29 Speaker_1\\n\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\n00:06:31 Speaker_2\\n\\nWhat is heart?\\n\\n00:06:34 Speaker_2\\n\\nSo what if if we start with something this big?\\n\\n00:06:38 Speaker_2\\n\\nI just definitely know this career, but it's hard. It's gonna be hard. Or you can you can sort of see through. Ohh, that's great actually.\\n\\n00:06:43 Speaker_1\\n\\nOhh you.\\n\\n00:06:44 Speaker_1\\n\\nIt.\\n\\n00:06:45 Speaker_1\\n\\nNice.\\n\\n00:06:53 Speaker_2\\n\\nOh.\\n\\n00:07:00 Speaker_1\\n\\nOh, that's smart that we can paint the rest black.\\n\\n00:07:05 Speaker_2\\n\\nOh, nice.\\n\\n00:07:10 Speaker_2\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:07:12 Speaker_2\\n\\nThis already maybe this goes too fast already, I don't know.\\n\\n00:07:16 Speaker_2\\n\\nLet's just see. So I did like 5 pages, something I should remain a square actually, but.\\n\\n00:07:24 Speaker_1\\n\\nMHM.\\n\\n00:07:26 Speaker_1\\n\\nI think going fast is not a problem.\\n\\n00:07:28 Speaker_2\\n\\nSo what if this is like?\\n\\n00:07:31 Speaker_2\\n\\n6.\\n\\n00:07:34 Speaker_1\\n\\nI don't think we will see it.\\n\\n00:07:39 Speaker_1\\n\\nNo, not bad. Not bad, not bad.\\n\\n00:07:42 Speaker_2\\n\\nOK, so it goes pretty fast.\\n\\n00:07:43 Speaker_1\\n\\nA little bit slower, maybe just a bit.\\n\\n00:07:46 Speaker_2\\n\\nYes, lower.\\n\\n00:07:48 Speaker_2\\n\\nYeah, just almost on the. Yeah. Yeah, too much of her. Yeah. So. But I think this is like half an output.\\n\\n00:07:50 Speaker_1\\n\\nBut it works.\\n\\n00:07:54 Speaker_2\\n\\nOr.\\n\\n00:07:54 Speaker_1\\n\\nSomething, yes, one would be, you know.\\n\\n00:07:55 Speaker_2\\n\\nSo I think one would be enough, I guess, yeah, should be fine.\\n\\n00:08:01 Speaker_1\\n\\nNow we are doing it or we will take a video of it later.\\n\\n00:08:01 Speaker_2\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:08:07 Speaker_2\\n\\nLet's draw it, I guess.\\n\\n00:08:09 Speaker_1\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:08:10 Speaker_2\\n\\nThen if I could take it home and make a nice video of it, maybe and then we could edit that too. I'm not sure if you do, we already have to do the text analysis like in the video or will we just?\\n\\n00:08:13 Speaker_1\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:08:23 Speaker_3\\n\\n2 minutes so it's too long.\\n\\n00:08:25 Speaker_2\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:08:26 Speaker_3\\n\\nUmm.\\n\\n00:08:28 Speaker_2\\n\\nWe can slow it down slow motion.\\n\\n00:08:32 Speaker_1\\n\\nBy the way.\\n\\n00:08:33 Speaker_1\\n\\nSorry I can do if you want, but I do.\\n\\n00:08:35 Speaker_2\\n\\nOh yeah, that would be great because I I really comes from. OK. I'm not. I'm gonna precise lines. I'm relaxed.\\n\\n00:08:41 Speaker_1\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:08:43 Speaker_2\\n\\nNice. OK, that's that's good.\\n\\n00:08:45 Speaker_1\\n\\nOK. So just one is enough.\\n\\n00:08:48 Speaker_2\\n\\nYeah, I guess this.\\n\\n00:08:50 Speaker_1\\n\\nCan I talk?\\n\\n00:08:51 Speaker_2\\n\\nSo we have through post it so we can try. Do you want a black fine line or is?\\n\\n00:08:56 Speaker_1\\n\\nThis fine. I'm just thinking maybe maybe this one I can use for planning and this one I finish.\\n\\n00:09:03 Speaker_2\\n\\nYeah, sounds good. OK.\\n\\n00:09:05 Speaker_1\\n\\nI guess talk now.\\n\\n00:09:09 Speaker_2\\n\\nIf you want a black fine liner, maybe it's more clear or.\\n\\n00:09:11 Speaker_2\\n\\nSomething I don't know.\\n\\n00:09:14\\n\\nLet me check.\\n\\n00:09:16 Speaker_1\\n\\nYeah, it's better, I guess. Thank you.\\n\\n00:09:22 Speaker_1\\n\\nSo the first one is this.\\n\\n00:09:26 Speaker_2\\n\\nSo I will describe this in a video.\\n\\n00:09:30 Speaker_3\\n\\nNo, I just.\\n\\n00:09:32 Speaker_2\\n\\nYou can take a video of the process maybe, yeah.\\n\\n00:09:40 Speaker_1\\n\\nShould I do it like? Should I take this off and draw it and stick it again, but then it won't won't be perfect.\\n\\n00:09:47\\n\\nRight.\\n\\n00:09:49 Speaker_2\\n\\nWe can try it for a few few slides like and see if it works I guess.\\n\\n00:09:56 Speaker_2\\n\\nIf if it's able to stick back.\\n\\n00:09:59 Speaker_2\\n\\nBecause they don't stick that well. We don't just now.\\n\\n00:10:01 Speaker_1\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n00:10:06 Speaker_1\\n\\nWell.\\n\\n00:10:08 Speaker_1\\n\\nIf I pay much attention, it seems no, it's not like it's.\\n\\n00:10:12 Speaker_2\\n\\nOr you can maybe you can sort of.\\n\\n00:10:18 Speaker_1\\n\\nFold it. Oh, let's see how it works, how it works. It would work.\\n\\n00:10:22 Speaker_2\\n\\nAnd then if you hold it together, it would be fine.\\n\\n00:10:28 Speaker_2\\n\\nOK. I guess yes, if you hold, it's correct. Maybe that gives you more room.\\n\\n00:10:32 Speaker_2\\n\\nTo draw yes.\\n\\n00:10:33 Speaker_1\\n\\nLet me try it.\\n\\n00:10:35 Speaker_2\\n\\nAnd then you can hold this one underneath. So then you have a flat campus which you now folded though.\\n\\n00:10:41 Speaker_1\\n\\nYeah. Nice. Thank you.\\n\\n00:10:44 Speaker_2\\n\\nI don't know if it's the best option, but.\\n\\n00:10:48 Speaker_1\\n\\nSo this is the.\\n\\n00:10:50 Speaker_1\\n\\nLast one last no first one first one is.\\n\\n00:10:53 Speaker_2\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n00:10:53 Speaker_2\\n\\nThe first one is the basically nothing, right? So we leave one empty and then it's comes from the edges I guess.\\n\\n00:10:58 Speaker_1\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n00:11:02 Speaker_1\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:11:02 Speaker_2\\n\\nIt's hard because you you think this is going to be when you planet, you think this is going to be a square, so you can just use the whole square where we can't actually because it sticks as well.\\n\\n00:11:12 Speaker_1\\n\\nLet's see.\\n\\n00:11:12 Speaker_2\\n\\nIt's maybe something for the difficulties or something.\\n\\n00:11:15 Speaker_2\\n\\nSome things that.\\n\\n00:11:16 Speaker_1\\n\\nAlmost.\\n\\n00:11:19 Speaker_1\\n\\nSquare.\\n\\n00:11:31 Speaker_1\\n\\nOr should it be a perfect square?\\n\\n00:11:38 Speaker_1\\n\\nShould it be perfect square or?\\n\\n00:11:41 Speaker_2\\n\\nWe can also do a. It's going to be clear. It's supposed to anyways. There's also working the process I guess.\\n\\n00:11:44 Speaker_1\\n\\nYes, OK.\\n\\n00:11:48 Speaker_1\\n\\nOK, I'm planning to paint the rest, but I'm not sure about that now.\\n\\n00:11:57 Speaker_1\\n\\nNo, I will.\\n\\n00:11:59 Speaker_2\\n\\nWell, it's going to be a lot of.\\n\\n00:12:00 Speaker_2\\n\\nPending in the end.\\n\\n00:12:03 Speaker_2\\n\\nThis one it's it's quick, but I don't know if it will bleed through the bleed to the rest of the paper.\\n\\n00:12:07 Speaker_1\\n\\nLet's see.\\n\\n00:12:20 Speaker_1\\n\\nNot bad.\\n\\n00:12:27 Speaker_1\\n\\nThis works.\\n\\n00:12:43 Speaker_3\\n\\nI'm gonna start a project too.\\n\\n00:12:45\\n\\n2.\\n\\n00:12:46 Speaker_1\\n\\nOh, I did it in the wrong. Sorry. What?\\n\\n00:12:48 Speaker_1\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\n00:12:50 Speaker_1\\n\\nDone to this space.\\n\\n00:12:53 Speaker_2\\n\\nOh, OK well.\\n\\n00:12:54 Speaker_1\\n\\nYeah, because now it's the first one. It's the last one. No, is this.\\n\\n00:12:57 Speaker_2\\n\\nOh yeah.\\n\\n00:12:59 Speaker_3\\n\\nOther size.\\n\\n00:13:01 Speaker_1\\n\\nNo, it's true, is it?\\n\\n00:13:05 Speaker_1\\n\\nIf we hold it like those.\\n\\n00:13:05 Speaker_2\\n\\nWait. Ohh. We hold it like that. OK, but it's harder to film because you want to. If you do like if you do like this then you can centre on the image better. I guess then if the image is going up.\\n\\n00:13:07 Speaker_3\\n\\nIt's also work.\\n\\n00:13:10 Speaker_1\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n00:13:13 Speaker_1\\n\\nWhich one is easier?\\n\\n00:13:18 Speaker_1\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:13:23 Speaker_1\\n\\nI think the other issue is can I take?\\n\\n00:13:25 Speaker_2\\n\\nYeah, sure.\\n\\n00:13:26 Speaker_1\\n\\nI think the other issue is when we hold it like this, we just see almost half of it, so it cannot be whole page. Maybe we can just.\\n\\n00:13:31 Speaker_2\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:13:35 Speaker_1\\n\\nDo it even smaller.\\n\\n00:13:36 Speaker_2\\n\\nYeah, that's that's OK.\\n\\n00:13:39 Speaker_2\\n\\nWe can make it a ripping their nose.\\n\\n00:13:43 Speaker_1\\n\\nOK. So again.\\n\\n00:13:44 Speaker_2\\n\\nWe have to sort of get a good angle that it's going to be like.\\n\\n00:13:50 Speaker_2\\n\\nLike, can I report this from like this angle so we can yeah. Sort of see if it if it if it if you can see how much you could see from this.\\n\\n00:14:02 Speaker_2\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:14:02 Speaker_3\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:14:07 Speaker_2\\n\\nI guess that's a good angle, right?\\n\\n00:14:15 Speaker_2\\n\\nI think this is the best angle because read it from top down and you you lose this whole part.\\n\\n00:14:27\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:14:28 Speaker_1\\n\\nSome.\\n\\n00:14:29 Speaker_1\\n\\nSo then zoom out wouldn't work right?\\n\\n00:14:33 Speaker_1\\n\\nMaybe nose, mouth. Just following.\\n\\n00:14:35 Speaker_2\\n\\nThat's also fine. Yeah. Yeah, because it adds because it's not really square. Yeah, that's fair. That's fair.\\n\\n00:14:37 Speaker_1\\n\\nYeah. And I cannot see. Yes.\\n\\n00:14:43 Speaker_1\\n\\nSo let me just try a piece of.\\n\\n00:14:47 Speaker_1\\n\\nPost it just doing this motion and falling down, yeah.\\n\\n00:14:50 Speaker_2\\n\\nOh yeah, like a leaf.\\n\\n00:14:55 Speaker_1\\n\\nLet's see what's going on.\\n\\n00:15:14 Speaker_2\\n\\nBy like annotating it? Or is it? Is it where it's coming from? From the side I do it from the.\\n\\n00:15:17 Speaker_1\\n\\nYeah, it's just coming.\\n\\n00:15:20 Speaker_2\\n\\nSide though it's also smart actually.\\n\\n00:15:52 Speaker_1\\n\\nThis brings me back to my child.\\n\\n00:16:42 Speaker_2\\n\\nSo do you make scripts to uh?\\n\\n00:16:47 Speaker_2\\n\\nTo go with the little movie.\\n\\n00:16:50 Speaker_1\\n\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\n00:16:52 Speaker_2\\n\\nOr will we just first maybe describe the process and then?\\n\\n00:16:57 Speaker_2\\n\\nShow some videos of us doing it, so if we just make some candid movies of yours to papers, what we weren't describing or something, and then.\\n\\n00:17:08 Speaker_2\\n\\nThen a little Peninsula motion that the the final product, there may be some kind of reflection.\\n\\n00:17:17 Speaker_2\\n\\nLike the.\\n\\n00:17:20 Speaker_2\\n\\nThe hardship we faced.\\n\\n00:17:23 Speaker_1\\n\\nYes, exactly.\\n\\n00:17:28 Speaker_2\\n\\nGood so.\\n\\n00:17:29 Speaker_2\\n\\nMaybe.\\n\\n00:17:35 Speaker_2\\n\\nSo start off with.\\n\\n00:17:44 Speaker_2\\n\\nFerocious.\\n\\n00:18:25 Speaker_3\\n\\nI want to go to.\\n\\n00:18:26 Speaker_3\\n\\nThe bathroom.\\n\\n00:18:27 Speaker_2\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n00:18:48 Speaker_2\\n\\n2 minutes. It's not that long you do music on the.\\n\\n00:18:54 Speaker_1\\n\\nWhole production.\\n\\n00:18:55 Speaker_2\\n\\nWhole production, you know, with the titles afterwards, you know, just like.\\n\\n00:19:01 Speaker_2\\n\\nArtist and your name and then.\\n\\n00:19:04 Speaker_1\\n\\nThat's all.\\n\\n00:19:07 Speaker_2\\n\\nCreative.\\n\\n00:19:09 Speaker_2\\n\\nCreative brain. Let's go.\\n\\n00:20:17 Speaker_2\\n\\nWe can also do a.\\n\\n00:20:21 Speaker_2\\n\\nUh title sequence.\\n\\n00:20:26 Speaker_2\\n\\nYeah, but it says we need to do that, actually.\\n\\n00:20:30 Speaker_2\\n\\nSo sure, why not include your names and video title and the short title sequence? Nice video title, the falling posters.\\n\\n00:20:31 Speaker_1\\n\\nWhat they do? Where?\\n\\n00:20:35 Speaker_1\\n\\nThat's cool.\\n\\n00:20:44 Speaker_2\\n\\nSounds very ominous.\\n\\n00:22:25 Speaker_1\\n\\nLet's see what happens so far.\\n\\n00:22:33 Speaker_2\\n\\nNot bad. Oh, damn, that looks cool actually.\\n\\n00:22:35 Speaker_3\\n\\nIt's it's looks field.\\n\\n00:22:42 Speaker_1\\n\\nCool.\\n\\n00:22:47 Speaker_3\\n\\nLet me again.\\n\\n00:22:50 Speaker_3\\n\\nWell, mom?\\n\\n00:22:52 Speaker_1\\n\\nTell me when you're ready.\\n\\n00:22:53 Speaker_3\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:22:59 Speaker_3\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:23:32 Speaker_3\\n\\nI start editing the video.\\n\\n00:23:35 Speaker_2\\n\\nYeah, I don't. Yeah, yeah, we could.\\n\\n00:23:40 Speaker_2\\n\\nOK, whatever little.\\n\\n00:23:43 Speaker_2\\n\\nI have a little storyboard. If you want. Maybe it's nice. So we first we should have a title sequence. So it says here in future names and video title and short title sequel.\\n\\n00:23:57 Speaker_2\\n\\nSo I just think maybe one screen for five seconds it says Title 2 projects and then.\\n\\n00:24:05 Speaker_2\\n\\nThe names I guess.\\n\\n00:24:10 Speaker_2\\n\\nThen the process we went through so then maybe show some of the images you would like. The videos you just took because this just shows the process, right?\\n\\n00:24:19 Speaker_2\\n\\nUh.\\n\\n00:24:34 Speaker_2\\n\\nThen maybe leading what we what we made.\\n\\n00:24:44 Speaker_2\\n\\nShow the products reflect on the product and reflect on the practise.\\n\\n00:24:50 Speaker_2\\n\\nBut that we can only do afterwards I guess.\\n\\n00:24:58 Speaker_2\\n\\nWe also should reflect on the editing practise, it says, but it.\\n\\n00:25:03 Speaker_3\\n\\nSure. OK. For you and we can modify them together.\\n\\n00:25:06 Speaker_2\\n\\nYeah, yeah, that's fine.\\n\\n00:25:09 Speaker_2\\n\\nFirst, what programme do you use?\\n\\n00:25:14 Speaker_3\\n\\nThis one.\\n\\n00:25:15 Speaker_2\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:25:16 Speaker_3\\n\\nYou maybe you don't.\\n\\n00:25:18 Speaker_3\\n\\nMaybe you don't know it, but it's it's really quick. Yeah. What's it called?\\n\\n00:25:25 Speaker_2\\n\\nWhat's it called the programme?\\n\\n00:25:27 Speaker_3\\n\\nThe English name is.\\n\\n00:25:29 Speaker_3\\n\\nLet me see his Chinese name.\\n\\n00:25:36 Speaker_3\\n\\nWait a minute. I can check in the store.\\n\\n00:25:51 Speaker_3\\n\\nThis one.\\n\\n00:25:53 Speaker_2\\n\\nOh, OK.\\n\\n00:25:53 Speaker_3\\n\\nIs it the same company with TikTok So.\\n\\n00:25:57 Speaker_2\\n\\nOhh good good.\\n\\n00:26:06 Speaker_2\\n\\nThe basic video editing just quick quick workflow, nice sounds good.\\n\\n00:26:20 Speaker_2\\n\\nIt's really like sort of drawing over the same lines over and over again.\\n\\n00:26:30 Speaker_2\\n\\nIf you still have too much space, then you oh nice. It definitely even turns.\\n\\n00:26:36 Speaker_2\\n\\nOhh love it, that looks great.\\n\\n00:26:37 Speaker_1\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n00:26:39 Speaker_1\\n\\nIt makes it.\\n\\n00:26:40 Speaker_2\\n\\nIf you're done before it, then you just. Then you just just do another one that start falling, and then we'll just never fall the whole way through that. Maybe I think that should be fun.\\n\\n00:26:42 Speaker_1\\n\\nI have.\\n\\n00:26:44 Speaker_1\\n\\nI should start doing this.\\n\\n00:26:59 Speaker_1\\n\\nIt's fun. I want to do it.\\n\\n00:27:01 Speaker_1\\n\\nLike as a whole, you know.\\n\\n00:27:04 Speaker_2\\n\\nAs does she meditated just like sort of drawing over those lines. And then just, you know.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAudiobestand\\n\\nNew Recording 5.m4a\\n\\nTranscriptie\\n\\n00:00:06\\n\\nNice. I love how big it is as well.\\n\\n00:00:11\\n\\nYeah, it's great.\\n\\n00:00:15\\n\\nCan we do a black, maybe a black screen for the first? What the title is? Yeah. Then then we can spread it out because we need to go to 2 minutes and I'm very much like, how are we gonna get 2 minutes from this?\\n\\n00:00:31\\n\\nI tried that\\n\\n00:00:35\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:01:09\\n\\nDone.\\n\\n00:01:10\\n\\nI love it.\\n\\n00:01:11\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\n00:01:14\\n\\nI wonder what?\\n\\n00:01:20\\n\\nThis is great.\\n\\n00:01:26\\n\\nI love this. Should we put Katy Perry on it? You know, a firework. Do you ever feel like a plastic bag drifting through the wind? I love it.\\n\\n00:01:28\\n\\nReally.\\n\\n00:01:35\\n\\nYeah, I think I like it too.\\n\\n00:01:40\\n\\nJust falling.\\n\\n00:01:42\\n\\nThat is great.\\n\\n00:01:43\\n\\nDo we need those kind of lines?\\n\\n00:01:47\\n\\nOh the the ohh the drafting the wind lines. Yeah, yeah, that sounds sounds cool.\\n\\n00:01:50\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:01:51\\n\\nLet me take a video\\n\\n00:01:53\\n\\nAll good.\\n\\n00:01:55\\n\\nEvery version. Wait a minute, wait a minute.\\n\\n00:01:58\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:02:12\\n\\nIt's in the whole art by itself to to do it as equally as possible as well, yeah.\\n\\n00:02:12\\n\\nCan you?\\n\\n00:02:19\\n\\nYou do realise that like adding the lines is?\\n\\n00:02:22\\n\\nDid you have to go over all the pages again?\\n\\n00:02:23\\n\\nYes, all over again.\\n\\n00:02:24\\n\\nRight.\\n\\n00:02:27\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:02:28\\n\\nBecause it feels like something like we just add the line every page again.\\n\\n00:02:32\\n\\nYeah, it's not just one.\\n\\n00:02:38\\n\\nMaybe.\\n\\n00:02:41\\n\\nJust.\\n\\n00:02:41\\n\\nHere and there, not all of them.\\n\\n00:04:32\\n\\nCan you add some text normally? Because I'm not sure.\\n\\n00:04:37\\n\\nAlright.\\n\\n00:04:39\\n\\nI guess I could do a voice over, if that's maybe after we made it.\\n\\n00:04:44\\n\\nYeah. Then we just should I just type.\\n\\n00:04:46\\n\\nOut a script maybe?\\n\\n00:04:48\\n\\nThen I'll just guess then.\\n\\n00:04:54\\n\\nI can do it on my laptop and then we just then later on that I'll record the voiceover, maybe with the video.\\n\\n00:05:00\\n\\nSo if if the video is done, if we edited everything together, then I can.\\n\\n00:05:04\\n\\nI think it's almost.\\n\\n00:05:04\\n\\nJust.\\n\\n00:05:06\\n\\nOh, really? OK, so it's almost 2 minutes already.\\n\\n00:05:12\\n\\nLet me see.\\n\\n00:05:14\\n\\nIt's one and 43.\\n\\n00:05:18\\n\\nOhh done yeah.\\n\\n00:05:20\\n\\nAnd we don't, we didn't do, we don't even have the the final product again.\\n\\n00:05:24\\n\\nIn the beginning and the process.\\n\\n00:05:27\\n\\nPutting.\\n\\n00:05:30\\n\\nAnd there's a process a lot of process.\\n\\n00:05:34\\n\\nAnd this can be like.\\n\\n00:05:39\\n\\nFailure trying.\\n\\n00:05:41\\n\\nYeah. Nice. And the first.\\n\\n00:05:47\\n\\nThis is the first version.\\n\\n00:05:49\\n\\nAnd we have nice and then we have the.\\n\\n00:05:55\\n\\nThen and then we can edit another little clip of her drawing. Maybe after this, so just one of the ones you already had. Maybe just just repeat it. So then we get to the revision part, basically, and then we can show the final ends when it. When it's done, I guess make a detailed thingy of that.\\n\\n00:06:00\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:06:03\\n\\nSure.\\n\\n00:06:15\\n\\nChildren.\\n\\n00:06:17\\n\\nIf you want, you can add it on my laptop.\\n\\n00:06:21\\n\\nOh yeah, but I don't know. The programmes. I didn't, I didn't, I think.\\n\\n00:06:23\\n\\nYou'll do it faster.\\n\\n00:06:24\\n\\nIt's just.\\n\\n00:06:27\\n\\nHold on. OK? Always. Can you from the so I can.\\n\\n00:06:27\\n\\nJust point it in.\\n\\n00:06:35\\n\\nYou need to click right maybe or..\\n\\n00:06:41\\n\\nSo another one where she's trying. Yeah, this one. If you could, could you maybe got this one and put it also back there or something because then we have a.\\n\\n00:06:51\\n\\nProcess products, process and products I guess.\\n\\n00:06:56\\n\\nOne this one put behind.\\n\\n00:06:58\\n\\nOr yeah, the binds here. Maybe because then we showed the that she's sort of revising what we already have.\\n\\n00:07:08\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:07:10\\n\\nSo maybe we can divide this.\\n\\n00:07:13\\n\\nCut into like 4 chapters. The first one is the process I guess. Yeah. And the second one is maybe.\\n\\n00:07:16\\n\\nMHM.\\n\\n00:07:22\\n\\nWe can also call it the brainstorm or something.\\n\\n00:07:27\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:07:28\\n\\nBecause then we also have to preprocess, I guess maybe. Yeah. It is part of the process, but then we have a more clear distinction maybe.\\n\\n00:07:37\\n\\nBrainstorming.\\n\\n00:07:38\\n\\nYeah, sounds good.\\n\\n00:07:41\\n\\nWhich we do is brainstorming.\\n\\n00:07:45\\n\\nThis one.\\n\\n00:07:48\\n\\nYeah, that's that's indeed. That's brainstorming, I guess, yeah.\\n\\n00:07:51\\n\\nBrainstorming at first.\\n\\n00:07:53\\n\\nYeah, I guess that, yeah, that should be good.\\n\\n00:08:03\\n\\nThe fall.\\n\\n00:08:06\\n\\nBrainstorming nice.\\n\\n00:08:10\\n\\nAnd then maybe the process is going to be.\\n\\n00:08:13\\n\\nMaking or trying or something.\\n\\n00:08:16\\n\\nTrain error prototyping.\\n\\n00:08:20\\n\\nSomething like this?\\n\\n00:08:23\\n\\nI couldn't.\\n\\n00:08:40\\n\\nAnd then year maybe.\\n\\n00:08:43\\n\\nFirst prototype of suits something like that so.\\n\\n00:08:49\\n\\nSo it's trying, yes and then?\\n\\n00:08:56\\n\\nThat's when she did the the first little part maybe. So when she showed the first couple slides that worked.\\n\\n00:09:06\\n\\nMHM.\\n\\n00:09:15\\n\\nTrying.\\n\\n00:09:21\\n\\nTrying.\\n\\n00:09:26\\n\\nYeah, this is the first. I guess this is the first prototyping right.\\n\\n00:09:30\\n\\nNice.\\n\\n00:09:33\\n\\nYeah, sure.\\n\\n00:09:35\\n\\nIt's OK. Yeah, no, it's fine.\\n\\n00:09:35\\n\\nThat's.\\n\\n00:09:42\\n\\nCan make it a little longer. If you want, then all the titles are.\\n\\n00:09:45\\n\\nThe same length.\\n\\n00:09:58\\n\\nNice and then revising or something.\\n\\n00:10:04\\n\\nI guess afterwards.\\n\\n00:10:07\\n\\nSo that's when she yeah.\\n\\n00:10:12\\n\\nWhat we yeah, refreshing revising or yeah, or refine. That's also a nice one.\\n\\n00:10:22\\n\\nRefinement.\\n\\n00:10:23\\n\\nYeah, the lines made it past.\\n\\n00:10:26\\n\\nOh yeah. Oh, that's cute.\\n\\n00:10:30\\n\\nI love it. It's very cute or something. I don't know why the video. This is great, right?\\n\\n00:10:40\\n\\nYep.\\n\\n00:10:41\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:10:43\\n\\nIn the end. Oh yeah, that's cool. Actually, maybe you can do that with zoom. Yeah, just a little bit bigger each time.\\n\\n00:11:05\\n\\nJust the.\\n\\n00:11:06\\n\\nSo it's we're fine and then?\\n\\n00:11:09\\n\\nI have video storyboarding we can do storyboarding.\\n\\n00:11:25\\n\\nNice.\\n\\n00:11:30\\n\\nAnd then.\\n\\n00:11:34\\n\\nI I would say final products and then.\\n\\n00:11:39\\n\\nOr or maybe say because we have an even more final. So what? What will we do for the?\\n\\n00:11:46\\n\\nSo put it when she shows there is.\\n\\n00:11:52\\n\\nWhat we call the.\\n\\n00:11:56\\n\\nThat's hard.\\n\\n00:12:01\\n\\nMaybe we can do.\\n\\n00:12:07\\n\\nSorry, like show the effect of the work. Yeah, yeah.\\n\\n00:12:17\\n\\nYeah, that could be.\\n\\n00:12:20\\n\\nWhat? What do you call something that's sort of final, but not yet?\\n\\n00:12:26\\n\\nPerfect.\\n\\n00:12:27\\n\\nYeah, OK. We already did that, yeah.\\n\\n00:12:30\\n\\nUh.\\n\\n00:12:35\\n\\n1st.\\n\\n00:12:37\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:12:40\\n\\nOr just say almost perfect or something.\\n\\n00:12:43\\n\\nSomething like that. And then we.\\n\\n00:12:44\\n\\nCan.\\n\\n00:12:45\\n\\nWork up to the end, I guess.\\n\\n00:12:49\\n\\nAlmost.\\n\\n00:13:04\\n\\nThe board as well.\\n\\n00:14:39\\n\\nWhat did you say about this?\\n\\n00:14:45\\n\\nSo almost perfect was always that one. OK, almost perfect. And then, oh, maybe collaboration or what was it?\\n\\n00:14:48\\n\\nThis is someone.\\n\\n00:15:02\\n\\nFinal touches or something final what final touch touch yeah.\\n\\n00:15:09\\n\\nAnd then and then we showed the real ends.\\n\\n00:15:12\\n\\nThe real real one. Maybe we could do that in a little bit of a slow motion. So it takes a little bit longer.\\n\\n00:15:19\\n\\nI don't know. It's great, actually. They went pretty fast. I think I'll I will record the the the audio at my home. I guess just like the only the the speech part. Yeah. Because I have a nice microphone there and then I can just and then I'll send it to you guys if if.\\n\\n00:15:31\\n\\nYou can explain.\\n\\n00:15:37\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:15:37\\n\\nThat's all OK, OK.\\n\\n00:15:38\\n\\nCan you send me the final?\\n\\n00:15:40\\n\\nDo you?\\n\\n00:15:41\\n\\nDid you just record it this one or what's the video?\\n\\n00:15:45\\n\\nThe final one.\\n\\n00:15:46\\n\\nI think we should final right now.\\n\\n00:15:47\\n\\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. I'll, I'll just. I'll just Thursday or something. I'll just record what I said over then. I'll just send it to you guys if I can make a WhatsApp group or something and then.\\n\\n00:15:57\\n\\nI'll send.\\n\\n00:15:58\\n\\nIt and then.\\n\\n00:15:59\\n\\nWe can or we can just film one final right now.\\n\\n00:16:03\\n\\nOh yeah, we can also do.\\n\\n00:16:04\\n\\nLet's first put this in and then we can talk over what we just saw, because then I can make that into one final recording with what we just say over this, I guess.\\n\\n00:16:15\\n\\nMaybe it like after I write we didn't film it right now it's good.\\n\\n00:16:19\\n\\nYeah, yeah, we we still do have to make the room with the with the stripes. Yeah, that's cool. Well, that's the best way to do this. Yeah, like this, right.\\n\\n00:16:33\\n\\nOnly the last person last.\\n\\n00:16:34\\n\\nCool.\\n\\n00:16:37\\n\\nThe last part I can continue writing the fall so it can stay longer.\\n\\n00:16:44\\n\\nThe fall comes to go.\\n\\n00:16:46\\n\\nWe.\\n\\n00:16:47\\n\\nI think it adds an ominous effect. You know, I don't.\\n\\n00:16:51\\n\\nWe can stay.\\n\\n00:16:53\\n\\nKnow is it too short?\\n\\n00:16:54\\n\\nThat you cannot actually see the text, I don't know.\\n\\n00:16:55\\n\\nNo, no, I think it's, it's not. It's not that problematic.\\n\\n00:17:01\\n\\nIt's very sure that I don't skip things.\\n\\n00:17:07\\n\\nIt's hearts. The last pieces are hard to OK. You were better.\\n\\n00:17:13\\n\\nAt this something on top of it so that it can go easy.\\n\\n00:17:13\\n\\nWhat if people?\\n\\n00:17:19\\n\\nOh, that's smart. Yeah.\\n\\n00:17:20\\n\\nLet's see. I'm not sure if it's going to.\\n\\n00:17:24\\n\\nYeah, I think yeah, because of the works better when you are in the.\\n\\n00:17:27\\n\\nBeginning. Yeah. So it's about having something on top or.\\n\\n00:17:34\\n\\nYeah, on top so.\\n\\n00:17:37\\n\\nThis can go here.\\n\\n00:17:51\\n\\nLet's see.\\n\\n00:17:57\\n\\nNot sure what you think.\\n\\n00:18:02\\n\\nMaybe two first.\\n\\n00:18:12\\n\\n122.\\n\\n00:18:13\\n\\nTry it now. Try it.\\n\\n00:18:20\\n\\nYeah, it works better. Yeah, right. OK. I think maybe sort of an angle. Shall I go stand behind a white wall? Maybe just looks nicer.\\n\\n00:18:21\\n\\nMuch.\\n\\n00:18:22\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:18:28\\n\\nOr wait, maybe we can do it?\\n\\n00:18:30\\n\\nOn top, no, it's not possible.\\n\\n00:18:35\\n\\nI think the graffiti works better if we do this or something. Yes, right.\\n\\n00:18:38\\n\\nYeah, even with the.\\n\\n00:18:40\\n\\nWood wall. There are some whites walls. Yeah, yes.\\n\\n00:18:45\\n\\nThere it is.\\n\\n00:18:49\\n\\nYou wouldn't do it. I feel like you could get it.\\n\\n00:18:52\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:19:03\\n\\nIs that closer?\\n\\n00:19:06\\n\\nYes, it's in 3X.\\n\\n00:19:08\\n\\nOh, that's nice.\\n\\n00:19:10\\n\\nYeah. OK.\\n\\n00:19:19\\n\\nYou should open it a bit.\\n\\n00:19:23\\n\\nOK, that's really good.\\n\\n00:19:25\\n\\nWhat if you just put it here? Just try it like this when you force it down. Yeah, so that you can go from here.\\n\\n00:19:43\\n\\nIt is true.\\n\\n00:19:44\\n\\nLet me.\\n\\n00:19:46\\n\\nOr you can just take some of it.\\n\\n00:19:51\\n\\nPerfect unexpectedly.\\n\\n00:19:58\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:20:11\\n\\nThat's the fall is is very hard to.\\n\\n00:20:13\\n\\nYeah, I think it's.\\n\\n00:20:14\\n\\nRight.\\n\\n00:20:22\\n\\nAnd then we.\\n\\n00:20:23\\n\\nAnd I was going down.\\n\\n00:20:24\\n\\nIn the slow motion.\\n\\n00:20:25\\n\\nYeah, we could try that. Now we have a couple of clips and then we'll see what should we do there. I mean maybe.\\n\\n00:20:35\\n\\nAnd I would record in the normal because that has a higher image.\\n\\n00:20:41\\n\\nRight.\\n\\n00:20:44\\n\\nI believe that means she's video poster.\\n\\n00:20:47\\n\\nAt the normal one.\\n\\n00:20:49\\n\\nI didn't know that.\\n\\n00:20:53\\n\\nI feel like this one is better.\\n\\n00:20:56\\n\\n30 to 60 seconds because it goes faster.\\n\\n00:21:00\\n\\nAnd then shall we do it in?\\n\\n00:21:02\\n\\nSlow. Let's try both.\\n\\n00:21:04\\n\\nThat's our both.\\n\\n00:21:05\\n\\nBut anyway, it helps if you do it.\\n\\n00:21:12\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:21:13\\n\\nI think you should stay here like.\\n\\n00:21:25\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAudiobestand\\n\\nNew Recording 7 1.m4a\\n\\nTranscriptie\\n\\n00:00:04\\n\\nI think this one also looks cool. What?\\n\\n00:00:06\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n00:00:06\\n\\nWhat is it just?\\n\\n00:00:13\\n\\nOhh, that looks cool. Yeah it is.\\n\\n00:00:19\\n\\nI can do it faster. It's better for me.\\n\\n00:00:21\\n\\nIt does look a little less fluid, but it does look cool.\\n\\n00:00:25\\n\\nYes, I will do it as fast as I can. Let's see what's going.\\n\\n00:00:31\\n\\nYou ready?\\n\\n00:00:34\\n\\nJust say when\\n\\n00:00:38\\n\\nI will do it one more time.\\n\\n00:00:41\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:00:42\\n\\nYeah, you got to know.\\n\\n00:00:44\\n\\n00:00:48\\n\\nCan I do it one more time? I think it was a bit.\\n\\n00:00:49\\n\\nYeah, of course.\\n\\n00:00:52\\n\\nYeah, it's slow. It's always stark between.\\n\\n00:00:55\\n\\nLike some page. I don't know why.\\n\\n00:00:59\\n\\nYeah. OK.\\n\\n00:01:06\\n\\nCan you open anymore?\\n\\n00:01:15\\n\\nAll this was a good one.\\n\\n00:01:15\\n\\nNothing, sorry.\\n\\n00:01:18\\n\\nPerfect. What was the the last?\\n\\n00:01:19\\n\\nNice. It sounded good. It sounded like individually.\\n\\n00:01:24\\n\\nYes, yes, the the not the last one, but this one before that.\\n\\n00:01:29\\n\\nYeah, this one.\\n\\n00:01:41\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:01:42\\n\\nAnd this is the first one.\\n\\n00:01:53\\n\\nYeah, it's not faster than the normal video, but I think the effect.\\n\\n00:01:58\\n\\nOf the fake.\\n\\n00:01:59\\n\\nMore.\\n\\n00:02:03\\n\\nYou see.\\n\\n00:02:06\\n\\nMm-hmm.\\n\\n00:02:32\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:02:36\\n\\nWhat would you?\\n\\n00:02:37\\n\\nLike.\\n\\n00:02:43\\n\\nSo.\\n\\n00:02:45\\n\\nI don't think it, I think.\\n\\n00:02:45\\n\\nThat's too much.\\n\\n00:02:46\\n\\nIt's.\\n\\n00:02:48\\n\\nI I don't even see it. I don't think my camera.\\n\\n00:02:50\\n\\nRolls see it. It does.\\n\\n00:02:54\\n\\nYou think? Yes. Yes, it does. Look. But my eyes have a higher frame rate than the camera is, right.\\n\\n00:02:56\\n\\n00:02:59\\n\\nThing is, we will be seeing the page overlapping you know.\\n\\n00:03:04\\n\\nYou want to try.\\n\\n00:03:05\\n\\nYeah, I think you got motion blur or something.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAudiobestand\\n\\nNew Recording 8.m4a\\n\\nTranscriptie\\n\\n00:00:03\\n\\nThe last one I'm curious about.\\n\\n00:00:15\\n\\nNo, nothing great. No, no, no, it's not working.\\n\\n00:00:16\\n\\nIt's.\\n\\n00:00:19\\n\\nIt's too fast or it's not working.\\n\\n00:00:26\\n\\nJust bits and pieces, no?\\n\\n00:01:22\\n\\nThis one is promising.\\n\\n00:01:25\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:01:28\\n\\nThat's the second.\\n\\n00:01:29\\n\\nYeah. So this is also.\\n\\n00:01:34\\n\\nYep.\\n\\n00:01:44\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\n00:01:45\\n\\nNo problem.\\n\\n00:02:09\\n\\nWe can see.\\n\\n00:02:10\\n\\nThe tea in the yeah, it's OK.\\n\\n00:02:12\\n\\nIt's OK. You can't imagine that either.\\n\\n00:02:45\\n\\nSo what's the final final one? So the text?\\n\\n00:02:50\\n\\nWhat? What should I say?\\n\\n00:02:58\\n\\nProducts, I don't know.\\n\\n00:03:01\\n\\nWhat's what is we're trying.\\n\\n00:03:02\\n\\nThe.\\n\\n00:03:03\\n\\nTo story like for the final for the final video.\\n\\n00:03:10\\n\\nEnd products now end end products or something.\\n\\n00:03:10\\n\\nNot birthday type.\\n\\n00:03:14\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n00:03:16\\n\\nFinal final products.\\n\\n00:03:23\\n\\nIt's a very quick design process. Yeah. Yeah, really.\\n\\n00:03:23\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\n00:03:31\\n\\nYou can charge your bottle. What? What? What does your bottle charge?\\n\\n00:03:36\\n\\nYou mean this? Yeah, it can, you know.\\n\\n00:03:41\\n\\nIt's to heat it up. Yeah. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. Cool.\\n\\n00:03:44\\n\\nIt's it's convenient when you travel like in hotel.\\n\\n00:03:49\\n\\nThat's so cool.\\n\\n00:03:50\\n\\nReally. Oh.\\n\\n00:03:53\\n\\nIs it Philips? Yeah. Oh, that's so nice.\\n\\n00:03:54\\n\\nCool.\\n\\n00:04:15\\n\\nWe can watch the end results and maybe talk over it a bit and then I could.\\n\\n00:04:19\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:04:21\\n\\nRecord the final audio trick.\\n\\n00:04:24\\n\\nYeah, if you're OK with.\\n\\n00:04:26\\n\\nIt's because it's 40 plus.\\n\\n00:04:30\\n\\nOh yeah, I'm OK with if we talk over it, then I'll just record it in a good microphone and I'll send out your truck. Yeah. What? WhatsApp. And now we can put it on there.\\n\\n00:04:40\\n\\nIt's.\\n\\n00:04:41\\n\\nLike it's going to take me 10 or 15 extra minutes, so that's fine.\\n\\n00:04:44\\n\\nYeah. Perfect.\\n\\n00:04:55\\n\\nWe have two minutes. That's good. Yeah. I'm not really down. We can just.\\n\\n00:04:57\\n\\nOhh, you're done with this 9.\\n\\n00:05:01\\n\\nYeah, watch it.\\n\\n00:05:06\\n\\nNice.\\n\\n00:05:19\\n\\nUnderneath this we just talk, I guess.\\n\\n00:05:38\\n\\nYeah. Why didn't you do this?\\n\\n00:05:39\\n\\nYeah, it took so much, yeah.\\n\\n00:05:45\\n\\nIt's a joke.\\n\\n00:05:49\\n\\nNext week you'll be done then.\\n\\n00:06:03\\n\\nIt's very therapeutic also to watch, you know.\\n\\n00:06:05\\n\\nYes it is. It is.\\n\\n00:06:08\\n\\nNice.\\n\\n00:06:13\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:06:22\\n\\nIt's weird to see yourself, right?\\n\\n00:06:24\\n\\nI think it's pretty cute.\\n\\n00:06:25\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:06:35\\n\\nWhat did you see the.\\n\\n00:06:37\\n\\nThis sort of a reflection almost because you see the other side as well.\\n\\n00:06:40\\n\\nOh, the yes. Yeah, you're right.\\n\\n00:06:50\\n\\nThe.\\n\\n00:06:51\\n\\nThe fall, there we go.\\n\\n00:07:05\\n\\nNice. Looks good. OK, shall we? Which is one more time. And then I'll say what? What comes to mind when we see those clips are that we can make it.\\n\\n00:07:07\\n\\nYeah, it's pretty good.\\n\\n00:07:14\\n\\nYes, yes.\\n\\n00:07:16\\n\\nA.\\n\\n00:07:17\\n\\nNice story.\\n\\n00:07:18\\n\\nYes, that's fine.\\n\\n00:07:31\\n\\nThat's nice. Also. Yeah, I think I think it's too, like too long it. Take patience to watch it.\\n\\n00:07:37\\n\\nNo, but we're going to talk when I need it, right? So it's then it's if we talk on the need it, it's only sort of to.\\n\\n00:07:46\\n\\nDo you? Do you think like this part are too lonely to be shorter?\\n\\n00:07:50\\n\\nNow, if we just talk about something cool then.\\n\\n00:07:51\\n\\nNo.\\n\\n00:07:53\\n\\nYes. Is it 2 minutes?\\n\\n00:07:55\\n\\nYeah, it it should be two minutes so.\\n\\n00:07:56\\n\\nYeah, it's 2 minutes and one second.\\n\\n00:07:59\\n\\nOhh, there maybe no no.\\n\\n00:08:02\\n\\nNo, that's fine. And then the first bit our names need.\\n\\n00:08:05\\n\\nTo be in there? Yeah as well.\\n\\n00:08:07\\n\\nAdd.\\n\\n00:08:07\\n\\nYour name? Yeah.\\n\\n00:08:10\\n\\nSo can you spell?\\n\\n00:08:12\\n\\nIt. Yeah, it's ODINE.\\n\\n00:08:18\\n\\nOdin. Odin. OK.\\n\\n00:08:21\\n\\nYeah, and.\\n\\n00:08:23\\n\\nPR is PINAR.\\n\\n00:08:28\\n\\nYeah. Amazing.\\n\\n00:08:34\\n\\nHow do you spell yours?\\n\\n00:08:38\\n\\nAvery.\\n\\n00:08:40\\n\\nAve. OK, nice.\\n\\n00:08:41\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\n00:08:43\\n\\nSo.\\n\\n00:08:44\\n\\nIs there anything to change?\\n\\n00:08:49\\n\\nNot really.\\n\\n00:08:50\\n\\nNo, the video seems perfect.\\n\\n00:08:53\\n\\nYeah, seems good. And then, OK, let's let's watch it one more time and just say what comes to mind. So I know what to.\\n\\n00:08:57\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:08:59\\n\\nTalk about, I guess.\\n\\n00:09:00\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:09:08\\n\\nWait.\\n\\n00:09:10\\n\\nWith you.\\n\\n00:09:16\\n\\nLet's go.\\n\\n00:09:17\\n\\nNice.\\n\\n00:09:20\\n\\nYou will talk or will.\\n\\n00:09:22\\n\\nWe'll, we'll talk. So then we'll start off with talking about the brainstorming. So how we settle the problem and that we actually came pretty quickly to 1st ID that we started to to try it out as quickly as possible. So that's where the first problems arrived. We saw that we.\\n\\n00:09:41\\n\\nCouldn't really get the full.\\n\\n00:09:43\\n\\nPage because you also need to flip it so some bit of it falls away.\\n\\n00:09:49\\n\\nWe wanted to go with the following positive because it's always falling down.\\n\\n00:09:53\\n\\nYeah. Nice. Nice motivation. So with the first prototype, we noticed that that maybe we should keep it vertical instead of horizontal. And then because the post will be falling for longer since we had the space is.\\n\\n00:10:12\\n\\nOr whatever. I will say that that I was just the therapeutic work and Pinard did some great drawing. So we saw it. The the concept worked. So we started on the video storyboarding.\\n\\n00:10:31\\n\\nWe looked at how we were gonna plan that and we immediately started editing. So Avery was starting with editing and Odin was helping and doing.\\n\\n00:10:49\\n\\nSome more inputs on the video as well. Then we saw the the, the, the almost final product. But we did think it needed some final touches, so we thought the wind would that was blowing would be a nice touch and we also thought we should.\\n\\n00:11:08\\n\\nHave the ominous title in the end as well.\\n\\n00:11:12\\n\\nTo sort of close off the product so you can see it with the wind blows behind the post, it's I think something like that I guess.\\n\\n00:11:24\\n\\nYeah, that's more than enough.\\n\\n00:11:25\\n\\nYeah. And I think like.\\n\\n00:11:29\\n\\nThis part maybe it's the first approach. Timing is too short for your elaboration and we can we can delay, we can delay this.\\n\\n00:11:30\\n\\nM.\\n\\n00:11:38\\n\\nCaption.\\n\\n00:11:40\\n\\nSo you have.\\n\\n00:11:40\\n\\nA long time. Ohh for the for the what was before that? It was the first prototyping. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's that should be good. So.\\n\\n00:11:51\\n\\nMaybe.\\n\\n00:11:55\\n\\nSo it was about first. Can you play it while I I.\\n\\n00:11:59\\n\\nWell, I I'll go for it. So first prototyping, we started to notice some first problems. We decided to really try it out and then we went on to what was the next one.\\n\\n00:12:13\\n\\nSo we could do it somewhere like here. I couldn't just make it shorter or longer. It doesn't really matter, OK.\\n\\n00:12:16\\n\\nHello.\\n\\n00:12:19\\n\\nWhat did you just remove? Which title?\\n\\n00:12:22\\n\\nWhat was on here? Refinements. OK, so yeah, I just put that here. Maybe somewhere in the middle. Yeah, I'll just. I'll make sure to just talk as long as it's the title. I think it will be fine. Otherwise, maybe there will be a a second of silence. But I think everyone would like that.\\n\\n00:12:28\\n\\nIn the.\\n\\n00:12:44\\n\\nLike the most it can be just two minutes, 2 minutes. Silence is also OK, yeah.\\n\\n00:12:46\\n\\nYeah, exactly.\\n\\n00:12:50\\n\\nOr process what?\\n\\n00:12:55\\n\\nIt's going to be going to be fine. Should we maybe make a group WhatsApp group and then I can just send it when it's done and you can send me the the video as well. OK, we'll transfer me or something. The transfer it via e-mail, because then I have the full quality video.\\n\\n00:13:13\\n\\nAnd can we? Can I also have a list of numbers so.\\n\\n00:13:16\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:13:17\\n\\nLet me make it wait.\\n\\n00:13:20\\n\\nI can make the group if you guys get your number.\\n\\n00:13:23\\n\\nYes, Sir.\\n\\n00:13:39\\n\\nYeah. Nice. Amazing.\\n\\n00:13:43\\n\\nMP4 is.\\n\\n00:13:44\\n\\nOK. Yeah, yeah, that's fine.\\n\\n00:13:48\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:13:51\\n\\nCan you put your number in?\\n\\n00:13:59\\n\\nWhere to add the number?\\n\\n00:14:02\\n\\nThis is the name, yeah. And then the number is there.\\n\\n00:14:03\\n\\nOK. Thank you.\\n\\n00:14:14\\n\\nI don't remember.\\n\\n00:14:16\\n\\nIt's multiple phone number. Sure. Yeah, that's true.\\n\\n00:14:24\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:14:25\\n\\nIt's always hard to remember your phone number.\\n\\n00:14:29\\n\\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. Your next change.\\n\\n00:14:42\\n\\nI didn't see.\\n\\n00:14:56\\n\\nColours.\\n\\n00:14:57\\n\\nYou have WhatsApp on that number or.\\n\\n00:15:00\\n\\nYou have WhatsApp on the phone number you gave me. OK, I cannot find you yet, but.\\n\\n00:15:02\\n\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\n00:15:08\\n\\nI always.\\n\\nAudiobestand\\n\\nNew Recording 8.m4a\\n\\nTranscriptie\\n\\n00:00:03\\n\\nThe last one I'm curious about.\\n\\n00:00:15\\n\\nNo, nothing great.

Yeah.\\n\\n00:08:10\\n\\nSo can you spell?\\n\\n00:08:12\\n\\nIt. Yeah, it's ODINE.\\n\\n00:08:18\\n\\nOdin. Odin. OK.\\n\\n00:08:21\\n\\nYeah, and.\\n\\n00:08:23\\n\\nPR is PINAR.\\n\\n00:08:28\\n\\nYeah. Amazing.\\n\\n00:08:34\\n\\nHow do you spell yours?\\n\\n00:08:38\\n\\nAvery.\\n\\n00:08:40\\n\\nAve. OK, nice.\\n\\n00:08:41\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\n00:08:43\\n\\nSo.\\n\\n00:08:44\\n\\nIs there anything to change?\\n\\n00:08:49\\n\\nNot really.\\n\\n00:08:50\\n\\nNo, the video seems perfect.\\n\\n00:08:53\\n\\nYeah, seems good. And then, OK, let's let's watch it one more time and just say what comes to mind. So I know what to.\\n\\n00:08:57\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:08:59\\n\\nTalk about, I guess.\\n\\n00:09:00\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:09:08\\n\\nWait.\\n\\n00:09:10\\n\\nWith you.\\n\\n00:09:16\\n\\nLet's go.\\n\\n00:09:17\\n\\nNice.\\n\\n00:09:20\\n\\nYou will talk or will.\\n\\n00:09:22\\n\\nWe'll, we'll talk. So then we'll start off with talking about the brainstorming. So how we settle the problem and that we actually came pretty quickly to 1st ID that we started to to try it out as quickly as possible. So that's where the first problems arrived. We saw that we.\\n\\n00:09:41\\n\\nCouldn't really get the full.\\n\\n00:09:43\\n\\nPage because you also need to flip it so some bit of it falls away.\\n\\n00:09:49\\n\\nWe wanted to go with the following positive because it's always falling down.\\n\\n00:09:53\\n\\nYeah. Nice. Nice motivation. So with the first prototype, we noticed that that maybe we should keep it vertical instead of horizontal. And then because the post will be falling for longer since we had the space is.\\n\\n00:10:12\\n\\nOr whatever. I will say that that I was just the therapeutic work and Pinard did some great drawing. So we saw it. The the concept worked. So we started on the video storyboarding.\\n\\n00:10:31\\n\\nWe looked at how we were gonna plan that and we immediately started editing. So Avery was starting with editing and Odin was helping and doing.\\n\\n00:10:49\\n\\nSome more inputs on the video as well. Then we saw the the, the, the almost final product. But we did think it needed some final touches, so we thought the wind would that was blowing would be a nice touch and we also thought we should.\\n\\n00:11:08\\n\\nHave the ominous title in the end as well.\\n\\n00:11:12\\n\\nTo sort of close off the product so you can see it with the wind blows behind the post, it's I think something like that I guess.\\n\\n00:11:24\\n\\nYeah, that's more than enough.\\n\\n00:11:25\\n\\nYeah. And I think like.\\n\\n00:11:29\\n\\nThis part maybe it's the first approach. Timing is too short for your elaboration and we can we can delay, we can delay this.\\n\\n00:11:30\\n\\nM.\\n\\n00:11:38\\n\\nCaption.\\n\\n00:11:40\\n\\nSo you have.\\n\\n00:11:40\\n\\nA long time. Ohh for the for the what was before that? It was the first prototyping. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's that should be good. So.\\n\\n00:11:51\\n\\nMaybe.\\n\\n00:11:55\\n\\nSo it was about first. Can you play it while I I.\\n\\n00:11:59\\n\\nWell, I I'll go for it. So first prototyping, we started to notice some first problems. We decided to really try it out and then we went on to what was the next one.\\n\\n00:12:13\\n\\nSo we could do it somewhere like here. I couldn't just make it shorter or longer. It doesn't really matter, OK.\\n\\n00:12:16\\n\\nHello.\\n\\n00:12:19\\n\\nWhat did you just remove? Which title?\\n\\n00:12:22\\n\\nWhat was on here? Refinements. OK, so yeah, I just put that here. Maybe somewhere in the middle. Yeah, I'll just. I'll make sure to just talk as long as it's the title. I think it will be fine. Otherwise, maybe there will be a a second of silence. But I think everyone would like that.\\n\\n00:12:28\\n\\nIn the.\\n\\n00:12:44\\n\\nLike the most it can be just two minutes, 2 minutes. Silence is also OK, yeah.\\n\\n00:12:46\\n\\nYeah, exactly.\\n\\n00:12:50\\n\\nOr process what?\\n\\n00:12:55\\n\\nIt's going to be going to be fine. Should we maybe make a group WhatsApp group and then I can just send it when it's done and you can send me the the video as well. OK, we'll transfer me or something. The transfer it via e-mail, because then I have the full quality video.\\n\\n00:13:13\\n\\nAnd can we? Can I also have a list of numbers so.\\n\\n00:13:16\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:13:17\\n\\nLet me make it wait.\\n\\n00:13:20\\n\\nI can make the group if you guys get your number.\\n\\n00:13:23\\n\\nYes, Sir.\\n\\n00:13:39\\n\\nYeah. Nice. Amazing.\\n\\n00:13:43\\n\\nMP4 is.\\n\\n00:13:44\\n\\nOK. Yeah, yeah, that's fine.\\n\\n00:13:48\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n00:13:51\\n\\nCan you put your number in?\\n\\n00:13:59\\n\\nWhere to add the number?\\n\\n00:14:02\\n\\nThis is the name, yeah. And then the number is there.\\n\\n00:14:03\\n\\nOK. Thank you.\\n\\n00:14:14\\n\\nI don't remember.\\n\\n00:14:16\\n\\nIt's multiple phone number. Sure. Yeah, that's true.\\n\\n00:14:24\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n00:14:25\\n\\nIt's always hard to remember your phone number.\\n\\n00:14:29\\n\\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. Your next change.\\n\\n00:14:42\\n\\nI didn't see.\\n\\n00:14:56\\n\\nColours.\\n\\n00:14:57\\n\\nYou have WhatsApp on that number or.\\n\\n00:15:00\\n\\nYou have WhatsApp on the phone number you gave me. OK, I cannot find you yet, but.\\n\\n00:15:02\\n\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\n00:15:08\\n\\nI always.\""
